Stream is not a data structure.
It does not alter the existing collection/data structure we are operating.
Stream is a sequence of objects which supports various operations which can be pipelined to produce the desired result.
There are two types of Operations on Streams : 1)Intermediate Operations 2)Terminal Operations

#Intermediate Operations
It enables the concept of filtering.
One stream is filtered by next stream and so on.
The intermediate methods are: 1)map 2)filter 3)sorted

#Terminal Operations
They return the final value.
No more filtering after using terminal operation methods.
Three terminal operations : 1)collect 2)foreach 3)reduce
collect method collects the final result
foreach iterates through each element
The reduce method is used to reduce the elements of a stream to a single value.
